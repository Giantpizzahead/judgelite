# Contributing to JudgeLite

First of all, thanks so much for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

Since this isn't really an official project, there aren't many contribution guidelines you need to follow. In fact, it could probably be summed up in one sentence: "**If you want to contribute, go ahead!**"

### Code of Conduct

We do have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/Giantpizzahead/judgelite/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (although it's completely copied from a template :laughing:). Basically, as long as you aren't being rude to other people, you're welcome to help out!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are bad. We all hate them. So if you come across a bug, pleaseeeeeeeeee [report it](https://github.com/Giantpizzahead/judgelite/issues/new/choose) on Github! You don't even need to follow the template if you don't want to. The more bugs we fix, the better JudgeLite will be!

### Suggesting Features

Features are great as well, and useful features would help make JudgeLite an even better judge! If you have any ideas for new features, feel free to [suggest them](https://github.com/Giantpizzahead/judgelite/issues/new/choose) by making a feature request in the Issues tab on Github.

### Pull Requests

These are a bit weirder to do. It probably isn't the best idea to make a pull request without any previous conversation. However, the codebase of JudgeLite is actually pretty easy to contribute to (it's not that big, and the code mostly makes sense / is somewhat documented).

So for now, probably report an issue or suggest a feature first. If you want to help us solve that issue / make the feature by creating a pull request, let us know by saying that in the issue / feature report (I doubt there will ever be a case where we'll say no to a pull request, but just in case...).

#### Tests

As a side note, we do have tests in the **tests** folder. If you do make a pull request, try to add a test for the code you write. It's not mandatory, but we wanna try to keep our codecov in the A range (to get that sweet 4.0 GPA :smile:).

Again, thanks so much for helping us out! We really appreciate it :heart:
