#### BONUS (10 points)

After thinking about her schedule a bit, Mary realized that there are some days where she's fine with wearing either type of clothing (business or casual). These days will be represented by the integer $2$ (in addition to the $0$ for business and $1$ for casual).

The question remains the same: Help Mary determine the minimum # of times she has to wash her clothes in order to wear the correct type of clothing for all of the $N$ days in her schedule (if she acts optimally - this includes her choice of business or casual clothing for the days of type $2$).
