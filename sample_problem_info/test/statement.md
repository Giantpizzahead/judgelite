This problem serves as a way for you to test the submission system. It also shows off sample cases, along with a special mode where subtask numbers are not shown!
Each test case gives you a single integer as input (from 1 to 10). Just echo the integer back to get AC.
Have fun experimenting!

Sample input: 1
Sample output: 1

Scoring (out of 100):
Grading method is average (partials allowed). There is 1 sample case. If this sample doesn't pass, none of the other cases will be evaluated.
1 bonus point is available as well! ;)
