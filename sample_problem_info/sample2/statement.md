I like to echo. Do you like to echo?
(Oh by the way, I also like doubling numbers. Big numbers. HUGE numbers.)

#### INPUT FORMAT

Something to echo, consisting of only alphanumeric characters, possibly separated by a bunch of single spaces. There will be exactly one newline (at the end of the input).

#### OUTPUT FORMAT

???

#### CONSTRAINTS

Grading method is average_stop (partials allowed, but stops on the first failed test for each subtask).
250 points for subtask 1, 250 points for subtask 2, 500 points for subtask 3.

Note: A real problem probably shouldn't have this many test cases (it'll slow down the system). This is just to show off the capabilities of the judge system. ðŸ˜ƒ

#### SAMPLE INPUT
```text
