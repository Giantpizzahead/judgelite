# Scoring method can be one of the following options:
# minimum = The minimum score out of all test cases in a subtask is used. If one test case fails in a
#   subtask, the rest are immediately skipped (there would be no reason to continue anyways).
# average_stop = The score for each test case is averaged out to determine the points for each subtask. The
#   judge will stop on the first failed test in a subtask (the rest are skipped / treated with a score of 0).
# average = The score for each test case is averaged out to determine the points for each subtask. The
#   judge will not stop early when evaluating a subtask, but it will only run a subtask if all the subtasks
#   it depends on got a non-zero score (at least one test case passed in each depends-on subtask).
